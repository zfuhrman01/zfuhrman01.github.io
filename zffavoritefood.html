	<h2> Pizza </h2>
	<p> My absolute favorite food of all time is pizza.</p>
	<p> I recently studied abroad in Italy, where I took the above photo of a pizza pie. In Italy, I tried all different types of Pizza: White Pizza, Margharita Pizza, and Vegetable Pizza. Click on the links below for some recipies to make my favorite kinds of pizza at home!

		</ul>

	<p> Pizza is great because there is so much you can do with it. You can be creative and make up your own, or you could follow the recipe from your favorite restaurant. You can make a breakfast pizza or a desert pizza. The pizza possibilites are endless!</p>
